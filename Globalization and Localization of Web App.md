#### Globalization vs Localization
- **Globalization**: Designing software for the input, display, and output of  a defined set of Unicode supported language, scripts and data relating to specific locales and cultures.
- **Localization**: The process of customizing or translating the separated data and resources needed for a specific language-locale pair.

#### Tips and Tools
- [Setting language preferences in a browser](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-priorities.en)

#### Library
- **[i18next](http://i18next.com/)** is a very popular internationalization library for browser or any other javascript environment (eg. node.js).
- **[i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n)** Lightweight simple translation module with dynamic json storage. Supports plain vanilla node.js apps and should work with any framework (like express, restify and probably more) that exposes an app.use() method passing in res and req objects.
- **[vue-i18n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-i18n)** Internationalization plugin for Vue.js
